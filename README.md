# AEBT
AutoEncoder Barlow Triplets (AEBT) is a non-contrastive self-supervised framework that disentangles semantic and transformation embeddings. Using a dual-encoder, projection head, and lightweight decoder, it jointly optimizes Barlow Triplets, reconstruction, and decorrelation losses to learn semantic and transformation-aware representations.
